DESCRIPTION

This project ports the Windows application Emu28 written in C to Android.
It uses the Android NDK. The former Emu28 source code (written by Christoph Giesselink) remains untouched because of a thin win32 emulation layer above Linux/NDK!
This win32 layer will allow to easily update from the original Emu28 source code.
It can open or save the exact same state files (state.e??) than the original Windows application!

This application does NOT come with the ROM files!
You will need KML scripts and ROM files already copied into your Android filesystem.
You can download the KML scripts from the original Emu28 Windows application archive (https://hp.giesselink.com/emu28.htm)
and you can extract the ROM file from a real calculator (or be lucky on internet).
Be careful about the case sensitivity of the filename in the KML script (Linux is case sensitive, not Windows).

The application does not request any permission (because it opens the files or the KML folders using the content:// scheme).

The application is distributed with the same license under GPL and you can find the source code here:
https://github.com/dgis/emu28android


QUICK START

1. From the left side, slide your finger to open the menu.
2. Touch the "New..." menu item.
3. "Select a Custom KML script folder..." where you have copied the KML scripts and ROM files.
4. Pick a calculator.
5. And the calculator should now be opened.


NOTES

- For technical reason, this application need the Android 5.0 (API 21).
- The Help menu displays Emu28's original help HTML page and may not accurately reflect the behavior of this Android version.
- When using a custom KML script by selecting a folder, you must take care of the case sensitivity of its dependency files.
- This Emulator does not include the ROM files or the KML files.
- To speed up printing, set the 'delay' to 0 in the calculator's print options.


NOT WORKING YET

- Disassembler
- Debugger
