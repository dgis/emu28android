DESCRIPTION

This project ports the Windows application Emu28 written in C to Android.
It uses the Android NDK. The former Emu28 source code (written by Christoph Giesselink) remains untouched because of a thin win32 emulation layer above Linux/NDK!
This win32 layer will allow to easily update from the original Emu28 source code.
It can open or save the exact same state files (state.e28) than the original Windows application!

This application does NOT come with the ROM files!
You will need KML scripts and ROM files already copied into your Android filesystem.
You can download the KML scripts here: http://regis.cosnier.free.fr/soft/androidEmu28/Emu28-KML-original.zip
Or you can download the KML scripts from the original Emu28 Windows application archive (https://hp.giesselink.com/emu28.htm)
and you can extract the ROM file from a real calculator (or be lucky on internet).
Be careful about the case sensitivity of the filename in the KML script (Linux is case sensitive, not Windows).

The application does not request any permission (because it opens the files or the KML folders using the content:// scheme).

The application is distributed with the same license under GPL and you can find the source code here:
https://github.com/dgis/emu28android


QUICK START

1. From the left side, slide your finger to open the menu.
2. Touch the "New..." menu item.
3. "Select a Custom KML script folder..." where you have copied the KML scripts and ROM files.
4. Pick a calculator.
5. And the calculator should now be opened.


NOTES

- For technical reason, this application need the Android 5.0 (API 21).
- The Help menu displays Emu28's original help HTML page and may not accurately reflect the behavior of this Android version.
- When using a custom KML script by selecting a folder, you must take care of the case sensitivity of its dependency files.
- This Emulator does not include the ROM files or the KML files.
- To speed up printing, set the 'delay' to 0 in the calculator's print options.


NOT WORKING YET

- Disassembler
- Debugger


CHANGES

Version 1.1 (2020-05-24)

- Intercept the ESC keyboard key to allow the use of the BACK soft key.
- Add LCD pixel borders.
- Add support for the dark theme.
- Remove the non loadable file from the MRU file list.
- Fix: Overlapping window source position when Background/Offset is not (0,0).
- Wrap the table of content in the former help documentation.
- Save the settings at the end of the state file.
- Transform all child activities with dialog fragments (to prevent unwanted state save).
- Fix an issue with the numpad keys which send the arrow keys and the numbers at the same time.
- Fix a major issue which prevented to open a state file (with a custom KML script) with Android 10.
- Optimize the speed with -Ofast option.


Version 1.0 (2019-12-12)

- First public version available. It is based on Emu28 version 1.33 from Christoph Gießelink.
- It should have all the feature of Emu42 for Android version 1.2.

TODO

- Try to include the KML files without the ROMs.
- Sometimes, the calculator seems to lag and finally freeze.
- Anyway that the layout settings (zoom mode, fill screen...) be part of the saved state, rather than being global to the app (Vincent Weber).


BUILD

Emu28 for Android is built with Android Studio 3.4 (2019).
And to generate an installable APK file with a real Android device, it MUST be signed.

Either use Android Studio:
* In menu "Build"
* Select "Generate Signed Bundle / APK..."
* Select "APK", then "Next"
* "Create new..." (or use an existing key store file)
* Enter "Key store password", "Key alias" and "Key password", then "Next"
* Select a "Destination folder:"
* Select the "Build Variants:" "release"
* Select the "Signature Versions:" "V1" (V1 only)
* Finish

Or in the command line, build the signed APK:
* In the root folder, create a keystore.jks file with:
** keytool -genkey -keystore ./keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -validity 9125 -alias key0
** (or keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore ./keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -validity 9125 -alias key0)
* create the file ./keystore.properties , with the following properties:
    storeFile=../keystore.jks
    storePassword=myPassword
    keyAlias=key0
    keyPassword=myPassword
* gradlew build
* The APK should be in the folder app/build/outputs/apk/release

Then, you should be able to use this fresh APK file with an Android device.
